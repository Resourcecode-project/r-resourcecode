The goal of `{resourcecode}` is to provide an easy access to the Resourcecode hindcast database of sea-states. More information on the database can be found [here](https://resourcecode.ifremer.fr). This website only contains information about the way to retrieve data from this data base and the functionalities offred by this package.

## Installation

The `{resourcecode}` package is on CRAN so you can simply run :

```{r install, eval=F}
install.packages("resourcecode")
```

You can install the development version of `{resourcecode}` thanks to [r-universe](https://resourcecode-project.r-universe.dev/resourcecode):

```{r install-r-universe, eval=F}
install.packages("resourcecode",
  repos = c(
    "https://resourcecode-project.r-universe.dev",
    "https://cloud.r-project.org"
  )
)
```

or using the classical:    
```{r install-dev, eval=F}
devtools::install_github("Resourcecode-project/r-resourcecode")
```

This package depends on data in a data package `{resourcecodedata}` that is available on CRAN on will be installed when installing the package for the first time.

## Examples

Plot the bathymetry used in the project

```{r bathymetry, fig.retina=3}
library(resourcecode)
library(resourcecodedata)
resourcecode::rscd_mapplot(rscd_field$depth, name = "Depth (m)", transform = "sqrt")
```


See the variables available in the database:
```{r variables}
head(rscd_variables)
```

Download a time series of significant wave height next to the coast of Finist√®re:
```{r data_fetcher, fig.retina=3}
data <- get_parameters(node = "134865", parameters = "hs")
str(data)
plot(data, type = "l")
```
