# resourcecode: Access to the 'RESOURCECODE' Hindcast Database

Utility functions to download data from the 'RESOURCECODE' hindcast
database of sea-states, time series of sea-state parameters and time
series of 1D and 2D wave spectra. See <https://resourcecode.ifremer.fr>
for more details about the available data. Also provides facilities to
plot and analyse downloaded data, such as computing the sea-state
parameters from both the 1D and 2D surface elevation variance spectral
density.
