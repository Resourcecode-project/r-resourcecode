This is a re-submission for Resourcecode 0.5.3.

This is only a patch release to update the failure message when remote resource is not available
and solves the errors on <https://CRAN.R-project.org/web/checks/check_results_resourcecode.html>

The vignette has been refactored to lower its building time, by skipping the download of new data.
