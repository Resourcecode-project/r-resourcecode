Description: Utility functions to download data from the 'RESOURCECODE'
    hindcast database of sea-states, time series of sea-state parameters
    and time series of 1D and 2D wave spectra.  See
    <https://resourcecode.ifremer.fr> for more details about the available
    data.  Also provides facilities to plot and analyse downloaded data,
    such as computing the sea-state parameters from both the 1D and 2D
    surface elevation variance spectral density.
